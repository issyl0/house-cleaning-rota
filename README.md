cleaning-rota
=============

We set up a cleaning rota for our house. The scrawl on the fridge
isn't that easy to read at a glance, so here's a web app that tells
you whether it's week A, B, or C, and who has to do what.

Eventually, it'll have a JSON endpoint that an Alexa skill (or
Messenger bot) can get data from.
